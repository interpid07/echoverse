# how it works
The Music Genre Classifier leverages deep learning and digital signal processing techniques to analyze audio and predict genres.

1.Audio Processing: The uploaded audio file is divided into overlapping chunks to capture various sections of the song.
2.Feature Extraction: Each audio chunk is converted to a Mel Spectrogram using torchaudio. The spectrogram is resized to a (210, 210) format to match the input dimensions expected by the model.
3.Model Prediction: The pre-trained TensorFlow model classifies each chunk into a genre. The final genre is determined based on the frequency of genre predictions across all chunks.
4.Visualization: A pie chart displays the genre distribution, with the primary genre highlighted.
